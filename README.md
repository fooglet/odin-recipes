I've learnt a lot of skills under HTML and the Odin Project's guidance in just this section alone.
<p> To list a few, I've memorised so far: </p> 
<ul>
<li> How to write in a <strong> bold font </strong> </li>
<li> How to write in <em> italics </em> </li> 
<li> I know the usual HTML outline of doctype, head, body, etc </li> 
<li> How to make lists both ordered and unordered (see?) </li>
<li> How to add paragraphs </li> 
<li> How to change the font <h4> size </h4>
<li> How to add pictures </li>
<li> How to change the image size </li>
<li> How to add descriptive text for the vision impaired </li>

<p> I think that just about sums it up. I'm really enjoying seeing my work appear on the screen and I am confident I have the above memorised. </p>
