<h2> What I have learnt in 'recipes'</h2>
</head>
<body> 
I've learnt a lot of skills under HTML and the Odin Project's guidance in just this section alone.
<p> To list a few, I've memorised so far: </p> 
<ul>
<li> How to write in a <strong> bold font </strong> </li>
<li> How to write in <em> italics </em> </li> 
<li> Memorized the usual HTML outline of doctype, head, body, etc </li> 
<li> How to make lists both ordered and unordered (see, I'm doing it) </li>
<li> How to add paragraphs </li> 
<li> How to change the font size </li>
<li> How to add pictures </li>
<li> How to change the image size </li>
<li> How to add descriptive text for the vision impaired </li> </ul>

<h3> <p> I think that just about sums it up.</P> <p> I'm really enjoying seeing my work appear on the screen and I am confident I have the above memorised. </h3> </p>
